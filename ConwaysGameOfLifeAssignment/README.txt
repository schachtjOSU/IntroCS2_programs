** Compiling **
Each of the files included in this file have been compiled using Visual Studio 2013.  You could also compile the files using gcc.  It should be noted, the files should not be compiled together, but as seperate programs.  To compile them all at once, I was provided with a makefile from the course which is included.

** Conway's Game of Life Program **
This program will be executing a zero-player game called Conway's Game of Life.  This program will ask the user for a configuration and the game will be played.  User can choose between an Oscillator, Glider, and a Cannon.  Please see the following link, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life, for Rules, its origins, etc.  The MainGame.cpp is the main file for this program and also requires the following supplemental files ConwayGameLife.cpp and ConwayGameLife.hpp.

** Supplemental Materials **
Included are word documents for a test plan and my reflections on the assignment.
