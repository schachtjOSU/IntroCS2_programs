** Compiling **
Each of the files included in this file have been compiled using Visual Studio 2013.  You could also compile the files using gcc.  It should be noted, the files should not be compiled together, but as seperate programs.  To compile them all at once, I was provided with a makefile from the course which is included.

** Conway's Game of Life Program **
This program will be executing a program where the user be able to stage created characters into a battle arena.  The user will be able to add or remove characters, list all available characters, and stage a fight between characters  The Arena.cpp is the main file for this program and also requires the following supplemental files Base.cpp , Base.hpp, Character.cpp, and Character.hpp.

** Supplemental Materials **
Included are word documents for a test plan and my reflections on the assignment.
