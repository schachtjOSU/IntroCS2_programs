** Compiling **
Each of the files included in this file have been compiled using Visual Studio 2013.  You could also compile the files using gcc.  It should be noted, the files should not be compiled together, but as seperate programs.  To compile them all at once, I was provided with a makefile from the course which is included.

** Final project Program **
The idea of this program is to be a world race, similar to the idea of 'Speed Racer' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_Racer).  The race is developed using 'linked lists' (http://pumpkinprogrammer.com/2014/06/13/c-tutorial-intro-to-linked-lists/).  The linked list created, links in some order a randomly generated regions (i.e. Forest, Swamp) where the player must race through.  Each region has it's challenges and a player may have additional challenges or an easier challenge depending on the player's choosen car.  The player chooses a car (creating a car object) and is able to get supplies for the journey.  The player wins the race, if the player beats all the other opponents.
